starting fresh:
- using testtest and building out is the plan

what currently works:
- turn # and turn incrementing
- place x / o based on turn
- placing x / o also places on connected array
- cannot place x on o, etc
- start match button disabled during game
- clearing both array and table after win
- starting a new game after winning (pog)
- win check for all options
- draw check
- final move is visible
- turn count


next up?
- grup things into gameboard and fix redundency

after that?
- implement players 
- implement score card
- make it pretty<3 ~*
