match logic

- take turn
- check win

player 1 odd #s
player 2 even #s

have a specific turn function we call each turn, 
iterate turn number at the end of a successful function

function match(player1, player2, gameboard) {
    let matchEnd = false;
    let turnCounter = 1;

    while (matchEnd === false) {

    }
}

function turn(tc) {
    if (tc % 2 !== 0) {
        
    }
}
